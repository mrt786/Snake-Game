It was my First Semester Project to make Snake Game with C++ GLUT library. It contains 6 foods(5 are square of different colours and 1 (The power food)is of ornage colour round in shape). Every food changes it location after every 20 seconds or when the snake eats while the power food changes it location after every 60 seconds. If the power food is eaten by snake, it waits for 60 seconds and then reappear. The difference between this food and others is that it increases score by 20 while other increase by 5 and also increase tail by one.On the top left there is a progress bar for the snake tails which also increases as the snake eats square foods. There are checks on foods that they donot appear in diagonals, same row, column and not on the hurdle. Addition to the game, a hurdle that is like a small l shape which is also present and it was made with the help of small 20 squares and changes it shape after 40 seconds. It changes it's shape randomly into vertical and horizontal in the screen at random position. The game ends if the snake hits the hurdle or tries to eat it's body itself.

To run this project you have to run these commands on Ubuntu terminal:

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew-dev libfreeimage-dev	




# how to install libraries first update by sudo apt update 
#the run the command chmod sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
# the run bash install-libraries.sh it will install the libraries then run make then ./game-release


To run on Windows:

Download GLUT:

Visit the OpenGLUT project page on SourceForge: OpenGLUT
Download the precompiled binary version of GLUT for Windows.
Extract the Files:

Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.
Copy Files:

Navigate to the extracted folder and copy the necessary files (e.g., glut.dll, glut.lib, glut.h) to your project directory or to a location where your compiler can find them.
Set up Your IDE:

If you're using an IDE like Visual Studio, you may need to configure the project settings to include the GLUT files. This typically involves adding the glut.lib file to the linker settings and adding the folder containing glut.h to the include directories.
Link the Library:

When compiling your project, make sure to link against the GLUT library (glut.lib).




On Mac:
Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
