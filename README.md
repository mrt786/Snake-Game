# Snake-Game
How to run commands is given in the Game Description File. However, about this project it is mentioned below:
It was my First Project to make Snake Game with C++ GLUT library.
It contains 6 foods(5 are square of different colours and 1 (The power food)is of ornage colour round in shape). 
Every food changes it location after every 20 seconds or when the snake eats while the power food changes it location after every 60 seconds. 
If the power food is eaten by snake, it waits for 60 seconds and then reappear. 
The difference between power food and others is that it increases score by 20 whilel other increase by 5 and also increase tail by one.
On the top left of the screen there is a progress bar for the snake tails which also increases as the snake eats square foods. 
There are checks on foods that they donot appear in diagonals, same row, column and not on the hurdle.
Addition to the game, a hurdle that is like a small l shape which is also present and it was made with the help of small 20 squares and changes it shape after 40 seconds.
It changes it's shape randomly into vertical and horizontal in the screen at random position. 
The game ends if the snake hits the hurdle or tries to eat it's body itself.
